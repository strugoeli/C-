In this exercise we were required to implement a part of the decryption of RSA( for relatively small numbers).
Important part of this exercise was to correctly work with overloading operator.
after the overloading of the operators we could better use the objects GField and GFNumber and in the most cases
we could treat GFNumbers as it was primitive number which made it easier to be focused on the logic of the program.

In order to factorize a number we used two different algorithms:

Trail Deviation:
Iterating from 2 to the number's square root and trying to divides the number.
this method is not efficient for big numbers


Pollard Rho:

In order to make our program more efficient we used this algorithm as long as we could in order to solve the problem or
at least make it smaller by dividing the number we wish to factorize.

(In this algo we had to check primacy with in not very efficient way but there are more efficient algorithms
to solve this problem)
