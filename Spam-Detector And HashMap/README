SpamDetector:

This program is given a path to a csv format file which every line of the file represents a pair of
(sequence, score) and a plain text and determines whether the given text is spam or not.


    Implementation :

    In order to store the pairs of the bad sequence and there score I implemented a hash map.
    the hash map give us the ability to efficiently (in terms of running time), store the pairs
    and easy access to them when needed.
    in this implementation of hash map I used Open hashing.I used a dynamic array of vectors
    each vector contains pairs of (string,int).


    Data Structure:

        Buckets ( vectors ) adding new value takes O(1) and checking whether a kay is contained takes linear time

        dynamic array (pointer to bucket) - access bucket takes constant time with given key
        (using it's hash code)

     Files:

        used std in order to read the file and parse it
        I also created a function that handle the appearance of {\n, \r, \r\n}, and converts the chars in the
        texts to lowercase letters (in the plain text and the sequences)
        so I can check properly if the lines from the files fit to the exercise condition.


      Memory allocation :

        Used dynamic array initialized with default capacity and every time of re hashing I
        created a new array with a new capacity and copy the content of the old one to it
        and then free the memory of the old one.
